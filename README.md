# ZMA Facility Engineering
This repository contains the master copies of important ZMA Faciliter Engineering documents and data that need to be versioned and released in a controlled manner. This repository is private and not accessible to the general public.

The purpose of this repository is to be:
* a master copy of the files.
* a natural (and undeletable) backup for disaster recovery purposes 
* a version management system for tracking difference between versions
* a release management system to identify which versions of the documents are released, and when
* an issue tracking system that allows others to record facility issues that need attention

For questions about this repository, contact the ZME Facility Engineer at fe@zmaartcc.net.
